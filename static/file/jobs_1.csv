Alternative Discretionary Technology is a small and agile team that works very closely with the front-office teams in the UK as well as the US for Man's discretionary strategies that operate in non-traditional markets. We develop and support a number of platforms for underwriting and ongoing management of private market assets like buy-to-rent housing portfolios, real estate debt and credit risk.
  

  

As a developer in Alt Discretionary Tech, you will develop and deploy features for every system that we've built as you communicate requirements and issues with the front-office teams in a way that is markedly different to dealing with exchange-listed securities. Dealing with Real Assets means working with tangible things like properties that have real-world physical and human interactions to cater for in our financial models.
  

  

Quant technology in private and alternative markets is a rapidly growing space in which Man is demonstrably on the cutting edge so there are opportunities here to make significant contributions in shaping this alongside the investment teams.
  

  

**Our Technology**
  

  

The target technology stack is on Linux with the majority of the code written in Python, using the full scientific stack like pandas and scikit-learn.
  

  

We also have C# integrations with Excel, and several web-based tools using a variety of languages and frameworks like React, Streamlit, FastAPI, Django, modern Angular and PHP.
  

  

We are heavy users of Man's own high performance proprietary database ArcticDB, alongside traditional RDBMS'.
  

  

Generative AI forms a growing part of our estate as it rapidly evolves and we find more use-cases in automation for our stakeholders.
  

  

All our code is deployed using Kubernetes and modern cluster computing frameworks.
  

  

**Working Here**
  

  

Man Tech has a small company, no-attitude feel. It is flat structured, open, transparent and collaborative, and you will have plenty of opportunity to grow and have enormous impact on what we do. We are actively engaged with the broader technology community.
* We host and sponsor London's PyData and Machine Learning Meetups
* We open-source some of our technology. See https://github.com/man-group
* We regularly talk at leading industry conferences, and tweet about relevant technology and how we're using it. See @manquanttech

We're fortunate enough to have a fantastic open-plan office overlooking the River Thames, and continually strive to make our environment a great place in which to work.
* We organise regular social events, everything from photography through climbing, karting, wine tasting and monthly team lunches
* We have annual away days and off-sites for the whole team
* As well as PC's and Macs, in our office you'll also find numerous pieces of cool tech such as a make-space, tech lending library and music room with guitars and a piano.

We offer competitive compensation, a generous holiday allowance, various health and other flexible benefits. We are also committed to continuous learning and development via coaching, mentoring, regular conference attendance and sponsoring academic and professional qualifications.
  

  

**Technology and Business Skills**
  

  

We strive to hire only the brightest and best and most highly skilled and passionate technologists.
  

  

**Essential**
* Exceptional technology skills; recognised by your peers as an expert in your domain
* A keen interest and understanding of financial markets and instruments
* A proponent of strong collaborative software engineering techniques and methods: agile development, continuous integration, code review, unit testing, refactoring and related approaches
* Strong knowledge of Python
* Proficient on Linux platforms with knowledge of various scripting languages
* Experience of data analysis techniques along with relevant libraries e.g. NumPy/SciPy/Pandas
* Relevant mathematical knowledge e.g. statistics, optimisation algorithms.
* Experience of web-based development and visualisation technology for portraying large and complex data sets and relationships

**Advantageous**
* Experience of front office quantitative software development e.g. in a hedge fund or investment bank

Experience in private market investment - for example real estate and private debt  
* 

  

  

**Personal Attributes**
* Strong academic record and a degree with high mathematical and computing content e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering or Physics from a leading university
* Craftsman-like approach to building software; takes pride in engineering excellence and instils these values in others
* Demonstrable passion for technology e.g. personal projects, open-source involvement
* Intellectually robust with a keenly analytic approach to problem solving
* Self-organised with the ability to effectively manage time across multiple projects and with competing business demands and priorities
* Strong interpersonal skills; able to establish and maintain a close working relationship with traders, quantitative researchers, and senior business people alike
* Confident communicator; able to argue a point concisely and deal positively with conflicting views.
* Team mentoring experience; as a senior engineer you will be able to support and teach junior quants the best practices in software development and financial engineering.
