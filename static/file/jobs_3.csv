Our operation runs 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and with that brings a wide variety of shift patterns. If you're looking for flexible working to fit around your lifestyle, then look no further! We'll work with you on your shifts, but late and weekend working is a requirement of our roles, and we may need to be flexible with your work pattern.  

  

Our Customer Delivery Drivers love their fast paced, varied role where no two days are the same. They thrive on making our customers happy every day by delivering our products right to their front door.  

  

When you're not on the road, you'll make sure your van is clean and fit for the next delivery (don't worry, you don't need to be an expert mechanic – we'll give you all the training you need) and when we are really busy, you'll be asked to help your team, picking and packing online orders.  

  

About You  

  

When you are on the road, you will need to be organised and as you we will expect you to be an excellent ambassador for the Asda brand.  

  

With that in mind, the personal qualities you bring to the role will be every bit as important as your skills and attitude. Friendly and approachable, you'll be the kind of person who'll put our customers first and do whatever it takes to deliver the best home shopping experience it can be.  

  

Asda, that’s more like it
