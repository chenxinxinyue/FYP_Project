Here’s how an average day may look:


You start your day in a team Stand Up discussing progress you made yesterday, listening to your team members describe their current issues. You’re working from home today, so you pay the pet tax and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.


First on your agenda is a feature request to feed through an extra property from a 3rd party API. You check its available in the test feed and then ensure it surfaces into the front end, refering to the figma designs provided to display it correctly on page. You commit the change and push it to peer review.


Next up is a pair-programming session with a Senior Developer on your team to aid you in resolving a couple of snags you've hit developing a complex frontend component they've been tackling. With a few hints and tips you make it past the blockers and settle down to continue on the component for the rest of the day.

**What You’ll Be Doing**
------------------------


The following should give you an idea of how you’ll be expected to typically be spending your time. It’s not set in stone and it may change from week-to-week, but it gives an idea of what is expected from the role.

### **Software Development (80%)**


The majority of your time will be spent working with your team to deliver software that meets the needs of our customers. This isn’t time that you’ll spend entirely in your editor, there’s stand up, sprint planning, scoping, architecting and designing that you’ll take part in to make sure we’re building exactly what we need in the right way.

### **Process and Tooling Improvements (10%)**


Making sure that we don’t sit still and keep evolving the way we build and deliver software is a critical investment of time, particularly from a team member with your experience. Use this time to try that tool you read about and see if it’s worthy of being a part of our toolchain.

### **Personal Development (10%)**


Keeping up with new software releases, development practices, horror stories and post-mortems are an essential part of any Software Developer’s time! Use this time to push forward your objectives and research tools and techniques you need to stay productive.

**Who You Are**
---------------


Here’s an idea of the type of experience you’ve got along with an idea of what we think would be useful to also know:

### **Technical Skills**

* Knowledge of front-end technologies such as HTML5 and SCSS
* Knowledge of back-end technologies such as NodeJS, Express or Koa
* Client-side & Server-side JavaScript and/or Typescript skills
* Working with third-party APIs
* Experience of the full software lifecycle
* Experience working with Git

#### **Knowledge and Experience**

* At least 1 years of development experience working in a development team within a commercial environment
* Experience dealing directly with non-technical stakeholders
* Highly motivated with demonstrable technical and analytical skills
* Desire to further technical skills and knowledge
* Attention to detail, commitment and desire to complete a consistently high standard of work
* Time management skills with the ability to manage own tasks to agreed timelines with limited supervision
* Able to clearly communicate complex design and development decisions
* Understanding of best practice and architecture for web applications
* Strong communication skills

**Your Responsibilities**
-------------------------


The following are the types of tasks that you may be required to perform as part of your role.

  

* Build Software
	+ Interpret business requirements and technical specification documents, to deliver an appropriate technical solution to agreed quality and timelines.
	+ Write software to an agreed set of coding standards
	+ Create, document, and implement automated test scenarios
	+ Create and maintain technical documentation
	+ Participate in manual testing of work in progress
* Maintain Software
	+ Perform maintenance development
	+ Investigate, analyse and document defects
	+ Correct identified defects
	+ Support customers out-of-hours as part of an on-call rota
* Communicate with Team
	+ Provide progress reports on tasks and projects
* Assist in Planning
	+ Participate in project planning meetings
	+ Create business requirement and technical specification documents
* Share Knowledge and Ideas
	+ Proactively suggest improvements in customer programmes of work
* Perform related duties as assigned.

**The small print**
-------------------


We are targeting an intensive week in Manchester at the start of July for this cohort of developers. Please indicate if this would be a problem for you in your application and what we can do to facilitate your attendance.


Whilst Space 48 is a remote first business, for the first 3 months we will expect 4+ days a month regular attendance into our Manchester office. This is reflective of the investment from the company and allows senior members of engineering to be to hand to assist issues etc.
