We're Policy Expert, a home and motor insurance provider and we're on a mission to shake up the personal insurance industry. We feel that insurers have under-served customers for too long with confusing policies, expensive renewals and frustrating claims processes. It is time to put customers first!



Since we formed in 2011, we've been using breakthrough thinking and proprietary tech to provide insurance that's clear, fair and great value. And people like what we do. So much so that we now have well over one million customers, driven by our double-digit growth. We also take great pride in having been the UK's No.1-rated home insurance provider for 9 years.



We have big aspirations. Our 'North Star' is 'To be the most successful insurance disruptor people want to stay with for life'. As we grow, we plan on continuing to challenge the norms of an insurance industry whose reputation for customer trust is low, where switching between providers is high and insurance cover is often seen as a costly 'grudge purchase'.



We aim to build longer and deeper relationships with our customers and to help them see insurance as being a help, not a hindrance.



Recently, we have been awarded an Outstanding 2 star accreditation and now rank within the Top 100 Best Large Companies 2023 to work for - https://www.b.co.uk/accreditation/2-star

We're Policy Expert, a home and motor insurance provider and we're on a mission to shake up the personal insurance industry. We feel that insurers have under-served customers for too long with confusing policies, expensive renewals and frustrating claims processes. It is time to put customers first!  

  

Since we formed in 2011, we've been using breakthrough thinking and proprietary tech to provide insurance that's clear, fair and great value. And people like what we do. So much so that we now have well over one million customers, driven by our double-digit growth. We also take great pride in having been the UK's No.1-rated home insurance provider for 9 years.



We have big aspirations. Our 'North Star' is 'To be the most successful insurance disruptor people want to stay with for life'. As we grow, we plan on continuing to challenge the norms of an insurance industry whose reputation for customer trust is low, where switching between providers is high and insurance cover is often seen as a costly 'grudge purchase'.



We aim to build longer and deeper relationships with our customers and to help them see insurance as being a help, not a hindrance.



Recently, we have been awarded an Outstanding 2 star accreditation and now rank within the Top 100 Best Large Companies 2023 to work for - https://www.b.co.uk/accreditation/2-star

**About HP Wolf Security**


The primary focus of the HP Wolf Security team is developing cyber security solutions to protect our customers devices and data. The digital threat landscape is ever-changing and as the cyber security industry reacts and adapts to changes, so too do the malware authors. Our unique micro-virtualization technology ensures that customers are protected from even the most bleeding edge cyber security threats. That micro-virtualization technology forms a key pillar in a wider cyber security suite that we're actively developing.

***Our history:***

*Inspired by the isolation principles of traditional virtualization, our team known then as Bromium, created a game-changing technology called micro-virtualization to protect end users against advanced malware. Every task the user performs, such as opening a document or clicking on a link, is isolated in its own micro-VM, with access to just the resources required for that task, and existing just for the life of the task. Protection is thus provided through isolation, without relying on detection, hence reliably defending the user from polymorphic and even zero-day malware.*

*Bromium was acquired by HP Inc on 19 September 2019 forming HP Wolf Security.*

Because we believe in doing right by leadership teams and their companies, we combine commercialism with a human touch. We’re honest and forthright in our actions. We distinguish between growing and selling a business, never pushing a client to exit.

**Champion curiosity.** 

Because we believe truly understanding a business is the starting point for making it better, we push ourselves and our clients to discover more. We are driven by the same entrepreneurial spirit as our clients. We ask the difficult questions that will bring about change. We listen to different perspectives.

**Adopt simplicity.**

Because we believe in being pragmatic and clear, we present ideas without clutter. We help leaders create the structures that allow them to work on their business – not be upended by it. We offer practical advice that moves our clients forward.

**Foster connection.**
